# Chat App - React Native

Chat App is a react-native application that I have written as a side project to explore new technologies. It allows users to communicate with each other in a chat room style environment. The technologies used here are :

 * Pusher - an API that is used to connect users to the chat room
 * Redux - for maintaining the global state of the application
 * Nodejs - handles connecting the front end with the Pusher API as well as authenticating the pusher client
 * BlockChain - A self implementation of a blockchain, each message in the log is a block in the blockchain, the log itself is the ledger

## Getting Started

Clone the repo onto your local machine using 

* **$git clone https://github.com/calebbsides/chatApp.git**

Navigate into the folder you just created

* **$cd chatApp**

Install all necessary files for running the application
* **$npm install**

After installing all dependecies, you should be able to start the application

* **$npm start**

After running the start command, the expo client will open which will allow you to open the app in a number of ways. I recommend texting or emailing yourself the link so that you can open on your own personal device.

## After you have the app running

It is relatively self explanatory from here. You will need to register an account to begin sending messages in the log.
